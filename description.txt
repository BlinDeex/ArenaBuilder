Customizable Arena adds 2 items and 1 tile to craft instant arena builder, so far you can set arena width,
height, floors, will it clear area or not(normally used for underground arenas), theme, campfires and/or heart lanterns placement.

For starters you will need 20 wood for arena module and 50 stone blocks with 4 iron ingots for arena customizer, last item is obtainable only through arena customizer with stats you decide on.

If you have any ideas or request for this mod let me know.
